## Shopping Cart
Project developed at the end of block 9, in which it was studied how to work with _Java Script and tests (Jest)_ when asynchronous.

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. By clicking on the `add to cart` button, the element appears inside the `shopping cart`;
2. When clicking on an element that is inside the `cart` it is removed from there;
3. The purchase subtotal is calculated automatically when an item is added to or removed from the `cart`;

4. There is an `empty cart` button that clears all the elements there;
5. There is a function that shows how many items are stored in the `cart` and also the possibility to leave it hidden or sample.

In addition, all the products shown are actually available on the Mercado Livre website, which is the API used to make this project.
